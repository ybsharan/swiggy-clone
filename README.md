## Swiggy Clone
Swiggy Clone is a personal project that replicates the popular food delivery application Swiggy. This web app is built using React, Parcel as the bundler, Redux Toolkit for state management, and Jest for testing. It incorporates various advanced React concepts and features to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience.


### Features

- **Real-time Data:**  Fetches and displays live restaurant data from the Swiggy API using `useState` and `useEffect`.
- **Routing:** Implements seamless navigation between different pages.
- **Search Functionality:** Enables users to quickly find specific restaurants or dishes.
- **Unit Testing:** Ensures individual components work correctly through testing.
- **Integration Testing:** Checks how different parts of the app interact with each other.
- **Shimmer UI:** Enhances user experience with loading placeholders.
- **Formik:** Simplifies form handling and validation for a smoother user experience.
- **Restaurant Details:** Users can explore individual restaurants and view the list of dishes available in each restaurant.

- **Cart Management:** Users can add items to their cart while browsing restaurants. They can navigate to the cart page to review the summary of their order.


## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **React:** The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Parcel:** Parcel is used as the bundler, simplifying the setup and build process of the application.

- **Redux Toolkit:** Redux Toolkit is used for state management, providing a standardized way to manage and update the application's state.

- **Jest:** Jest is the chosen testing library for unit testing components and ensuring their functionality.

## Advanced React Concepts üöÄ

- **Custom Hooks:** The app utilizes custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic, improving code organization and reusability.

- **Context API:** The Context API is employed to manage and share state across components without excessive prop drilling.

- **React Portals:** React portals are used to render modals and overlays, providing a better user experience for certain interactions.


## Testing üß™

The project includes a suite of tests written using Jest to ensure the reliability and correctness of the components.

To run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```
